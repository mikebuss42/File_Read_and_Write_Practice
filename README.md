            This program is an Inventory program that creates an
            inventory.txt file from scratch which you can add items
            and edit their information.

 CURRENT PROBLEMS:
            1) Program creates inventory.txt file which you use but
            deletes the file upon quitting.
            2) Program can only use "New Item" once. If used again,
            it erases all information of the other inventory items.
